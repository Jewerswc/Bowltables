Monetization Model Documentation

Project Overview

This project implements a subscription-based monetization model tailored for content-driven platforms such as blogs, news outlets, or online publications. The revenue generation strategy is dynamically influenced by two key metrics: Page Views (PV) and Average Interest Score (AIS) of each article. Subscribers are charged a fixed fee of £4.99 per month, and the revenue allocation per article is determined based on its performance and reader engagement.

**1. Monetization Model Overview**

**1.1 Subscription Structure**
Monthly Subscription Fee:
Users pay a fixed monthly fee of £4.99 to access premium content on the platform. This subscription grants them unlimited access to all articles and exclusive features.

**1.2 Revenue Generation**
Primary Revenue Source:
All revenue is generated exclusively through user subscriptions. There is no base revenue; the platform's income solely depends on the number of active subscribers.

**1.3 Revenue Allocation Factors**
The revenue allocated to individual articles is determined by two primary factors:

Page Views (PV):
Definition: The total number of times an article has been viewed by users.
Significance: Indicates the popularity and reach of the content.
Average Interest Score (AIS):
Definition: A metric representing the average engagement or interest level users have with an article.
Calculation: Derived from user interactions such as ratings, comments, shares, and time spent reading.
Significance: Reflects the quality and relevance of the content to the audience.

**2. Revenue Allocation Formula**

To ensure a fair and dynamic distribution of revenue, the platform allocates funds to individual articles based on their performance metrics. The allocation is determined by the following formula:

3. Implementation Strategy

3.1 Data Collection and Tracking
To effectively implement the monetization formula, accurate tracking of both Page Views (PV) and Average Interest Score (AIS) is essential.

Page Views (PV):
Method: Increment the PV count each time an article is accessed.
Storage: Maintain a counter associated with each article in the database.
Average Interest Score (AIS):
Method: Aggregate user interactions such as ratings or feedback.
Calculation: Compute the average score based on collected data.
Storage: Store the AIS as a floating-point number associated with each article.
3.2 Backend Processing
Subscriber Management:
Track the total number of active subscribers.
Handle subscription sign-ups, renewals, and cancellations.
Revenue Calculation:
Frequency: Monthly, aligning with the subscription billing cycle.
Process:
Calculate TMR based on the current number of subscribers.
Compute the total weight across all articles (
∑
j
=
1
M
(
PV
j
×
AIS
j
)
∑ 
j=1
M
​	
 (PV 
j
​	
 ×AIS 
j
​	
 )).
Allocate revenue to each article using the defined formula.
Data Storage:
Maintain records of revenue allocations per article for transparency and reporting.
Optionally, store historical data for trend analysis and auditing.
3.3 Frontend Integration
User Interface:
Provide a subscription interface where users can sign up for the service.
Display article metrics (PV and AIS) if relevant to content creators or administrators.
Dynamic Content Display:
Adjust content visibility based on subscription status.
Optionally, provide insights or dashboards for content performance.
